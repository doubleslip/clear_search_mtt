Clear Search Mtt
======
Clear Search Mtt (Clear Search More than Two) is a [userChromeJS](https://www.userchrome.org/what-is-userchrome-js.html) userscript for Firefox to clear the search bar (in the toolbar) after searching. Based on the dearly missed Clear Search 2 Firefox extension.

To be used with the *Add search bar in toolbar* setting in Firefox's settings/preferences. Also recommended to have *browser.search.openintab* (in about:config) set to `true` as well.

Tested using [xiaoxiaoflood's userChromeJS loader](https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts) on Firefox ESR 115.


## Installation
To use this script, install a loader for userChrome.js files (such as [xiaoxiaoflood's](https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts)). The instructions to add this script vary depending on the loader but typically would involve copying this script to a particular folder.
